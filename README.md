# JavascriptQuiz


## Description

I have created a simple Javascript Quiz to test the basic knowledge of Javascript facts for future users.

* There are 4 questions with 4 options each
* Each time a user gets a question wrong, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer
* The game ends when the timer runs out or when all questions are answered
* The user will then be presented with a highscores page and can choose to play again if they like
